# GitHub special files and paths

GitHub special files include `README`, `LICENSE`, `CONTRIBUTING`, etc. GitHub special paths include the root directory `/`, `/.github`, `/docs`, etc. These help automate repository health checks and developer interactions.  This page summarizes these files and paths. We welcome pull requests and welcome GitHub staff creating an official page that replaces this page.

## Introduction

GitHub special files can typically be written using freeform text or Markdown.
There are exceptions, such as the CODEOWNERS file, which uses a special syntax.

TODO: how to add other formats, such as ASCIIDOC?

GitHub special files can typically be located in three special directoies: root directory `/`, or the special purpose directory ``/.github` directory, or the `/docs` directory. There are exceptions, such as the PULL_REQUESTS_TEMPLATES directory, which contains special files.

TODO: any other special directories?

These files are sometimes called "community health files" or "metadata files" or "recommended repository files" or "well-known files". 

TODO: any other terminology?
