## Introduction

GitHub special files can typically be written with a variety of formats and file name extensions:

  * using freeform text, such as `README` or `README.txt`.

  * using Markdown, such as `README.md` or `README.markdown`.

  * TODO: any other formats, such as ASCIIDOC?
 
  * There are exceptions, such as the `CODEOWNERS` file.

GitHub special files are typicallylocated in special paths a.k.a. special directories:
 
  * `/` is the repository root directory

  * `/.github` is a dot files directory

  * `/docs` is a typical documention directory

  * There are exceptions, such as the `PULL_REQUESTS_TEMPLATES` directory.

  * TODO: any other special directories?

 
## History

Some of the file names have a very long history.

  * For example the file name `README` is a convention that goes far back to the 1980's or earlier. 

Some of the file names are unique to GitHub as far as we know.

  * For example the name `CODEOWNERS` and its syntax were created by GitHub staff.


## Also known as

The special files and paths are sometimes also known as:

  * community health files

  * recommended repository files

  * well-known files and well-known directories 

  * TODO: any other terminology?


## Community profile checklist

The GitHub community profile checklist checks to see if a project includes recommended community health files, such as README, LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING, etc.

TODO: how to add other files to the checklist?


## CODE_OF_CONDUCT

https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-code-of-conduct-to-your-project/

A code of conduct defines standards for how to engage in a community. It signals an inclusive environment that respects all contributions. It also outlines procedures for addressing problems between members of your project's community. 


## CODEOWNERS

https://help.github.com/articles/about-codeowners/

CODEOWNERS is a file that defines individuals or teams that are responsible for code in a repository.

Code owners are automatically requested for review when someone opens a pull request that modifies code that they own. When someone with admin or owner permissions has enabled required reviews, they also can optionally require approval from a code owner before the author can merge a pull request in the repository.
