## Introduction

GitHub special files can typically be written with a variety of formats and file name extensions:

  * using freeform text, such as `README` or `README.txt`.

  * using Markdown, such as `README.md` or `README.markdown`.

  * TODO: any other formats, such as ASCIIDOC?
 
  * There are exceptions, such as the `CODEOWNERS` file.

GitHub special files are typicallylocated in special paths a.k.a. special directories:
 
  * `/` (the repository root directory)

  * `/.github` (a special purpose directory for the company)

  * `/docs` (a typical documention directory)

  * TODO: any other special directories?

  * There are exceptions, such as the `PULL_REQUESTS_TEMPLATES` directory.


## History

Some of the file names have a very long history.

  * For example the file name `README` is a convention that goes far back to the 1980's or earlier. 

Some of the file names are unique to GitHub as far as we know.

  * For example the name `CODEOWNERS` and its syntax were created by GitHub staff.


## Also known as

The special files and paths are sometimes also known as:

  * community health files

  * recommended repository files

  * well-known files and well-known directories 

  * TODO: any other terminology?


## Community profile checklist

The GitHub community profile checklist checks to see if a project includes recommended community health files, such as README, LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING, etc.
